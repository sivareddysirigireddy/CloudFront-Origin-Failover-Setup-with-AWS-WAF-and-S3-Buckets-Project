# CloudFront-Origin-Failover-Setup-with-AWS-WAF-and-S3-Buckets-Project
Deployed a static website using AWS S3 and CloudFront with origin failover. Configured CloudFront to switch from a primary to secondary S3 bucket on error, ensuring high availability. Integrated AWS WAF for security, enabling fault-tolerant, secure, and globally distributed content delivery.
